Partners

My partners were Chelsea and Kaviya

Design process

I used my Scottish ogre head, Kaviya’s Teletubbies like body, and Chelsea’s hipster robot legs. I also added color to them

New background story
A Scottish ogre named Moss tries to blend into city life wearing a bright mascot torso and thrifted hipster jeans with red sneakers. He gets popular in the city and soon becomes a fashion icon thats learning to handle the new fame.
